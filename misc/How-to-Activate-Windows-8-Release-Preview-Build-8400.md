If you want to activate Windows 8 Release Preview Build 8400, you will need a valid product key that matches your edition of Windows. You can find the product keys for different editions of Windows 8 Release Preview on the official Microsoft website[^2^]. Alternatively, you can use a third-party tool called KMSAuto++ that can activate Windows and Office products using KMS (Key Management Service) technology[^3^]. However, this method is not recommended by Microsoft and may violate their terms of service.
 
To activate Windows 8 Release Preview Build 8400 using a product key, follow these steps:
 
1. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type slui.exe 3 and press Enter.
3. Enter your product key and click Activate.
4. Wait for the activation process to complete and restart your computer if prompted.

To activate Windows 8 Release Preview Build 8400 using KMSAuto++, follow these steps:

1. Download KMSAuto++ from a reliable source[^3^] and extract it to a folder on your computer.
2. Run KMSAuto++.exe as administrator.
3. Select Windows Activation from the main menu.
4. Click Activate Windows and wait for the process to finish.
5. Restart your computer if prompted.

Note: You may need to disable your antivirus or firewall software before running KMSAuto++, as it may be detected as a potentially unwanted program or malware. Also, you may need to re-activate your Windows every 180 days using KMSAuto++, as the activation is not permanent.
 
By following these methods, you should be able to activate Windows 8 Release Preview Build 8400 and enjoy its features. However, keep in mind that this is not the final version of Windows 8 and it may have some bugs or issues. It is recommended that you upgrade to the official release of Windows 8 when it becomes available.
